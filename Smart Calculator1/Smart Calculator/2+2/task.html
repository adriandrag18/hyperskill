<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Your task is to make a smart calculator. What do you usually expect from a calculator? Of course, it is bound to support 4 basic operations: multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction. But we don't stop there and add the ability to calculate expressions containing parenthesis and the ability to remember the previous result. This will be a console application, which you will improve gradually, from simple to complex.<br>
So, the first version of the calculator will only support the addition operation for two numbers. In this version, you will not receive the plus symbol (+) as an input, you will accept this as an unwritten rule (because only one operation is supported).</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>Write a program that reads two integer numbers from the same line and prints their sum in the standard output. Numbers can be positive, negative, or zero.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The example below shows the input and the corresponding output. Your program should work in the same way. Do not add extra characters after the output!<br>
<br>
The greater-than symbol followed by space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.</p>

<pre><code class="java">&gt; 5 8
13</code></pre>
