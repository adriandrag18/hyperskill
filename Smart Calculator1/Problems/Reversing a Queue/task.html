  <p>Suppose <code class="java">queue</code> is a pre-defined queue. Define <code class="java">reversed_queue</code>, a queue that contains the elements of the initial_queue in the reversed order.</p> 
  <p>For example, if queue contains elements 1, 2 and 3, then reversed_queue should contain elements 3, 2, 1.</p> 
  <p><code class="java">queue</code> is defined as a deque and is ready to use. Note that <code class="java">appendleft()</code> was used to add new elements to it, so the head of the queue is on the right.</p> 
  <p>You don't need to print out the resulting queue.</p>
